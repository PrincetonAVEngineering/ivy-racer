Things to do:

1. Create a function called get_lines(frame), which performs everything this script
   does, but returns the results instead of just plotting them.
2. Use compute_angle_v1.py to read in the video from road.mp4 and pass each frame into the roaddetection_angular.py
   function.
3. Create a basic steering solution based on the location of the intersection of the lines.
