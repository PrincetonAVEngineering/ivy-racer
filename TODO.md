# Things to do:

### Controller -- Arduino side:

1. Work with the controller python team to determine a communication protocol between the arduino and computer.
2. Create an echo program, which echos the values that are sent in through Serial in.
3. Implement the communication protocol with the ultrasonic sensor program. Confirm that this data is received and read by the computer.
4. Implement both step 2 and 3 to run concurrently.
5. Write different voltages to output pins react to different throttles.

1. Research and create a program to control the stepper motor. The stepper motor controller is 2SY556-A controller. Here's a link:
